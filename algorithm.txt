Downloaded what we went over in class (wordshop.py)

Imported re
Define getWordsFromFile module to fit the importing of the file and the first two for loops
Close iFile at the bottom of the last for loop, dedented once
Return words

Define main module
Create usedWords empty list
Open new file and Write the header "Word" and "Number of Occurences"
Create wordList equal to the getWordsFromFile module
Sort wordList
Make for loop to find words in wordList
If statement that finds if a word had been used.  If so, then it won't precede and will continue to the top of the loop
else it will append it to the used words
Write the individual words and their matching count number to the new file
Write to go to newline after every input
Close new file

Run main

TROUBLESHOOTING:
Had trouble figuring out how to get the words to only occur once.
Asked a friend for some helpful knowledge and he/she/it delivered
SOLVED *thumbs up emoji*
